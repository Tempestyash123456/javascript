Problem statement:

1. You will be given a CSV of SMS that contains OTP. You need to write code to extract OTP from the given SMS message.
2. You will be provided with the helper code [based on your preferred programming language]
3. You need to write the path to master data in getMasterDataFilePath().
4. And also write your logic inside function extractOtp(sms: String) and return the extracted OTP
5. A file named for failed test cases is also generating containing SMS messages where OTP extraction failed.

 
Note: SMS will contain OTP of length of in between 4-8
